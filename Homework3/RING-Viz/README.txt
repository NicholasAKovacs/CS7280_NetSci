0 - Remark

RING-Viz.py is a Python script to visualize Residue Interaction
Networks (RINs), generated by RING-2.0 software, directly in the 
structure with Pymol. It requires Python (>=2.7) and the Pymol 
molecular visualization system. It works both on Windows and
Unix systems.   

The RING method (first version) has been published in:

RING: networking interacting residues, evolutionary information and 
energetics in protein structures

2 - Installation

RING-Viz.py requires Python (>=2.7) and the Pymol molecular 
visualization system. To install Pymol in Windows you 
can follow this Wiki: 

	http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Windows_Install. 

For Linux (i.e. Ubuntu distribution) just install the repository 
version by issuing:

    sudo apt-get install pymol

3 - Execution and examples


The RIN-Viz.py script can be run from the command line (both in Windows 
and Linux) with this command:

    python RIN-Viz.py examples/3jqz_edges.txt 

The script opens Pymol and tries to download the PDB coordinates from 
the Internet. Consider that the script tries to infer the PDB ID (3JQZ) 
from the input file name (3jqz_edges.txt). To be sure you are loading the 
correct structure, the PDB file can be provided as input using the 
"-pdbFile" parameter:

    python RIN-Viz.py examples/3jqz_edges.txt -pdbFile examples/3jqz.pdb 

The program takes few seconds to load and at the end you should see 
your molecule with the connections drawn as lines.
By default RING-Viz draws all types of interaction and for each of them 
two new selections are created: one for the connecting lines (_edges) 
and another for the interacting residues (_nodes). By this, is possible 
to modify the view for example hiding or highlighting a specific type 
of interaction.
